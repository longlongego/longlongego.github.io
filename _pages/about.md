I'm pursuing my masterâ€™s degree in Control Science and Engineering at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn), co-supervised by Prof. [Xianghui Cao](https://automation.seu.edu.cn/cxh2/) and Assoc. Prof.[Chaoqun Yang](https://automation.seu.edu.cn/ycq/main.psp). My research interest includes natural language processing, LLMs with multi-modal, machine learning, computer vision, and human-computer interaction(HCI).

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
